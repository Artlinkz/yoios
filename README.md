### iOS 8 inspired icons for OS X Yosemite.

Due to demand on Twitter, I’ve decided to share these icons I made for personal use.

Keep in mind they haven’t been optimized for all sizes, my goal was pretty much make them look good in the Dock.

I’ll be adding more in the upcoming weeks/months, but feel free to download the template and play around with that. Please understand I’m not taking any requests at this point, I have a mouth to feed. :)

##### If you want to contribute with this project, download the template and [tweet me](http://twitter.com/marcelomarfil) a link of your icons. With your permission, I can periodically include them here, with due credits, of course.

### Notes

1. I use [LiteIcon](http://www.freemacsoft.net/liteicon/) to safely replace icons.
2. Icons exported/downscaled automatically with [Export to ICNS](https://github.com/solicomo/export-to-icns) by Soli Como
